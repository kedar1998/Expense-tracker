## Process

### Built With
- HTML
- CSS
- Tailwind CSS
- JavaScript

### What I Learned
- The working principle of this project is filtering out actions based on conditions.
- for example, if amount has preceding '+' sign the amount is added to income and if it has preceding '-' sign then amount is added to expense.  
- The amount of balance is incremented or decremented on basis of category of transaction i.e - added if income and subtracted if expense.
